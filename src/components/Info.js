            <p>Non-Violent-Communication, also known as Compassionate Communication, 
                is a practice developed by Marshall Rosenberg who, after studying Clinical Psychology 
                figured there must be a better way to approach human suffering than 
                to classify people into "crazy" and "sane", "good" and "bad".

                to express <i>observations, feelings, and needs</i> and finally formulate <i>requests</i>,
                we have a much better chance to be able to connect to one another and meet each others needs. 
                It's an incredibly powerful tool for conflict resolution and increasing your ability to empathise with yourself and others.

            <p>If you've never heard about <b>Non-Violent Communication (NVC)</b>, you're in for a treat!</p>
            <p>
                NVC is a school of thought, a communication practice, a way to see the world.
                It was developed by <b>Marshall Rosenberg</b> who, after studying Clinical Psychology 
                figured there must be a better way to approach human suffering than 
                to classify people into "crazy" and "sane".<br/>
                He noticed the inherent judgments in our language, and how they often get in the way of hearing one another. 
                Instead, when we learn to express <i>observations, feelings, and needs</i> and finally formulate <i>requests</i>,
                we have a much better chance to be able to connect to one another and meet each others needs. 
                It's an incredibly powerful tool for conflict resolution and increasing your ability to empathise with yourself and others.
